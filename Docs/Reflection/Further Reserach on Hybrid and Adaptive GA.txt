In the future, I would incorporate hybrid and adaptive GA by putting in a crossover rate to work with for each potential solution in a population per generation, which would likely be 3% for a small but effective crossover. For each solution, a random number between 0 and 1 would be generated to represent its crossover percentage. The solutions with this number being .97 or higher would be chosen as potential solutions. Then the heuristic for each solution would be calculated, where the one with the maximum heuristic would be chosen as a potential solution. This potential solution would then go through the verification and fitness functions like in this current project.
